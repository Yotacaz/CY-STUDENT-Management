\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structpromotion}{promotion}} \\*Structure representing a promotion containing students and courses dynamic tables }{\pageref{structpromotion}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structsect}{sect}} \\*Structure representing a section in the data file }{\pageref{structsect}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structstudent}{student}} \\*Structure representing a student. We suppose here that every student follows the same number of courses (n\+\_\+courses). In the f\+\_\+courses table, the courses are stored in the same order as in the Courses\+Tab of the promotion }{\pageref{structstudent}}{}
